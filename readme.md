To run the tests, cd into the respective directory containing the desired test file (COS316-Final-Project/sjf or COS316-Final-Project/srtf)

To run the test, type into the terminal "go test -v" (note that -v is necessary to see the output of performance statistics) and press enter.

Note that each test file runs the non-optimized and optimized version of the corresponding scheduling policy algorithm for that file directory.
